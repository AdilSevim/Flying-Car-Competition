# Flying-Car-Competition
This repository contains HezarFen Teamâ€™s autonomous flyingcar simulation code and documentation for the competition. Task-1 provides the baseline controller; Task-2 extends it with staged routing, charging logic, and robust landing/mission-resume capabilities. The project package includes Turkish and English design reports and a demo-ready setup.
